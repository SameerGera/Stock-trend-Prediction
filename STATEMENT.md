Project Statement

1. Problem Statement

Novice investors and students often struggle to understand the mathematical trends underlying stock market movements. While raw data is available, there is a lack of accessible, educational tools that visualize how basic machine learning algorithms (like Linear Regression) translate historical data into future trend lines without requiring complex coding knowledge.

2. Scope of the Project

The scope of TrendMaster is limited to an educational web application that:

Retrieves daily closing prices for US stocks.

Cleans and processes time-series data.

Applies a Linear Regression model to identify linear trends.

Visualizes the difference between actual price volatility and calculated trends.

Out of Scope: Real-time high-frequency trading, financial advice, complex Deep Learning (LSTM) models (due to resource constraints), and real-money transaction handling.

3. Target Users

Finance Students: To visualize statistical concepts applied to markets.

Computer Science Students: To understand the implementation of ML pipelines.

Hobbyist Investors: Looking for quick trend visualization tools.

4. High-Level Features

Data Ingestion: Automated connection to external financial APIs.

Trend Calculation: Computation of regression lines and future price points.

Metric Evaluation: Displaying statistical error rates to educate users on model reliability.

User Personalization: Ability to customize timeframes and prediction windows.
